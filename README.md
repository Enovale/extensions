# moonlight extensions

This repository houses the .asar files that are used for the [moonlight](https://moonlight-mod.github.io/) official repository.

## Contributing to this repository

The [sample extension](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/sample-extension) automatically packs .asar files and deploys them to GitHub Pages. Create a pull request adding or updating the .asar file into the `exts` folder. All pull requests are required to have their source repository in the description. It is suggested to directly download and re-upload the asar from GitHub Actions, which will ensure your pull request review passes faster.
